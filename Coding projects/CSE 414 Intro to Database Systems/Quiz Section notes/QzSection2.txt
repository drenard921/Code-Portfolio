CSE 414: Section 2 A seQueL to SQL

Agenda:
1. Extra 'must know'
     Keys, 3 valued logic, alias, filtering

2. Joins

3. Group By and Aggregation

4. Demo

5. Worksheet


Primary Keys vs Foreign Keys:

Primary Key - 
    * unique identifier for a row 
    * cannot be NULL
    * Must be unique

Foreign Key -
    * Column(s) used to reference 
      a primary key in another table
    * can be NULL
    * Does not need to be unique


Look at section slides for code examples:


SQL 3-Valued Logic:
    SQL has 3-valued logic:
        * FALSE = 0
        * UNKNOWN = 0.5
        * TRUE = 1

SQL 3-Valued Logic (cont):

<look at slides for context>


Aliasing:
    * Good style for renaming attribute operations to more intuitive labels
    * Essential for self joins 
    * You can alias without "AS" in the FROM clause 


Filters: <look at code from quiz section slides 4 syntax> 
    LIMIT number - limits the amount of tuples returned

    DISTINCT - only returns unique values (eliminates duplicates)


JOINS: (Ven diagram Joins useful on slide) 
    Joins information from two tables together
    * Inner vs. Outer - What's only in common betweeen 2 tables (Inner)
                        vs
                        What data from Db2 lines up with DB 1's columns (Outer) 
    * Self Joins - important when dealing with hierarchal information

    <Really good joins slide from quiz section slides>


JOIN Semantics:

* Think as "nested loops"/
* Not the most efficient implentation on a large database! 
  (We will talk about other ways to join later in the course)
    * Hash Join (cool Joins)
    * Sort-Merge Join (cool Joins)


FWS (FROM, Where, Select):

FWGHOS (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, SELECT):

GROUPING and ORDERING: 
* GROUP BY 
* HAVING 
* ORDER BY (default ASC/DESC)


    GROUP BY (for each statement):
    Careful When selecting:
    * only select attributes in GROUP BY or aggregates
    * SQLite will Guess (arbitrary pick a value)
