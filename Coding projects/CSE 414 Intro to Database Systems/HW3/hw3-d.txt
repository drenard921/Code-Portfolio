Prompt:
The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data
centers. Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service. What do you think about
the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud?

Microsoft Azure had an easy setup experience when first starting my database for this assignment.
I liked how it provides an interactive front end display to help users navigate their database once they've set one up with Azure.
As far as the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud, I feel like we use databases all the time without even realizing it 
and if there is public will to create a DBMS as a service in public cloud for educational and government institutions then by all means 
should go for it. The only draw backs might be concerns over service reliability and start-up costs 
as the service would be publically funded and budgets might fluctuate. 
The benefits to private owned databases is that they can generate the funds required for regular maitenence and innovate 
through market competiton. Also their cloud functionality helps eliminate extra associated costs with institutions 
setting up independent database hardware.
Only final concern would be that data security and privacy are regulated among private firms who operate cloud databases.
